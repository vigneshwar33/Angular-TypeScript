/*
Starting with ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript has a concept of modules. TypeScript shares this concept.

Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope; this means that variables, functions, classes, etc. 
declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms. 
Conversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.

    return x + y;
